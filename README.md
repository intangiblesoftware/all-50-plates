# All 50 Plates

Bored on a long car ride? Use the app to keep track of license plates you see on the cars around you. Try to get all 50 before the end of your trip!

--- 

This is my second Swift/SwiftUI app. My wife is a fan of playing the license plate game when we go on long car rides and she uses an app to keep track of the ones she found. I thought to myself, "hey, that would be fun and straightforward to build" so I did. I'd like to keep working on it, polishing it, getting a better iPad experience and use it as an opportunity to develop and Apple Watch app. 

**Version:** 1.0

**Language:** Swift

**Layout:** SwiftUI

**Known issues:** None

**Planned features:**
* Want to improve ending. Make congrats screen a modal popup so as to let users review all the plates they found and when they found them, 
* Build an Apple Watch extension/app to let people mark off plates they find with their watch. 
* Build a better experience for iPad. One big list would look ugly. Want to make it more grid-like. Have to see about that. Will be a fun project.
